## **3. Key Feature Modules**

### **A. Guardian AI™ Compliance Engine**
*The unique selling point of the platform. It acts as an automated 24/7 compliance officer.*
*   **Real-time Note Analysis**: As staff type progress notes, the AI analyzes the content against NDIS practice standards.
*   **Goal Alignment**: Automatically verifies if the care provided aligns with the participant's specific NDIS goals.
*   **Red Flag Detection**: Detects concerning language or incidents (e.g., "bruise", "fall", "refused medication") and instantly creates incident drafts.
*   **Invoice Auditing**: Before an invoice is generated, the AI scans all shifts for "Ghost Shifts" (overlapping times), missing progress notes, or duplicate claims, preventing fraud and NDIS audits.

### **B. Mobile App for Caregivers (iOS & Android)**
*A tool designed for the front-line worker—simple, offline-capable, and safeguards compliance.*
*   **GPS Smart-Fencing**: Staff cannot check in unless they are physically within the participant's geofenced location (home or facility).
*   **Offline Mode**: Workers can check in/out and write notes even in dead zones. Data automatically syncs when connectivity returns.
*   **Shift Dashboard**: Staff see their upcoming roster, client details, and specific care plans for the day.
*   **One-Tap Emergency**: Integrated distress alarm triggers notifications to supervisors with live GPS tracking.

### **C. Operations Command Center (Web Dashboard)**
*For Admin, Rostering, and Finance teams.*
*   **Live Operations Map**: An airport-style visualization showing every active staff member on a map in real-time. Green = On Time, Red = Late/Missing.
*   **Smart Rostering**: Drag-and-drop scheduling that warns you about staff fatigue, double-booking, or expired qualifications *before* you publish changes.
*   **NDIS Price Guide Integration**: The system automatically pulls the latest NDIS Pricing Arrangements (e.g., TTP rates, Saturday rates, Public Holiday rates) so you never undercharge.

### **D. Financial & Billing Automation**
*   **Bulk PRODA Exports**: Generate NDIS bulk upload files (CSV) in a single click for the entire organization.
*   **Payroll Interpretation**: Automatically calculates timesheets based on actual clock-in/out times, including complex rules like "Sleepover" vs. "Active Night".
*   **Budget Tracking**: Real-time tracking of a participant's funding usage. Alerts supervisors when a participant is burning through funds too quickly.

## **4. Technical & Security Specs (Trust Signals)**
*   **Data Sovereignty**: 100% Australian hosted (ensuring GDPR and Australian Privacy Principle compliance).
*   **Encryption**: Enterprise-grade encryption (AES-256) for all sensitive participant data.
*   **Role-Based Access**: Granular permissions ensure a casual worker can only see *their* client's data, not the whole organization's.

**Q: "How does it help with NDIS audits?"**
> **A:** *"We have a 'One-Click Audit' export. It zips up all progress notes, shift records, and roster changes for a specific participant into a neat package for the auditor."*
